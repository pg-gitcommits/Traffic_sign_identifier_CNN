In this project me and my colleague Deepak SKM (deepakm1909) are going to develop a traffic sign identification model. There are many different traffic signs like speed limit, traffic signals, indicating directions(left or right), etc. The dataset we are working on contains 50000 images of 43 classes which are numbered from 0 to 42.
